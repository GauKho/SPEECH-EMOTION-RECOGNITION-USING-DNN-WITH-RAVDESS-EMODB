# Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Neural Networks

## 📌 Introduction
- This project focuses on building a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** system using **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**.
- The system automatically identifies human emotions from speech signals by learning discriminative acoustic features.
- Two widely used benchmark datasets are employed:
  - **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)**
  - **EMO-DB (Berlin Emotional Speech Database)**
- The project is designed for:
  - Research and educational purposes
  - Real-world applications such as:
    - Virtual assistants
    - Human–computer interaction
    - Affective computing

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** model for speech emotion recognition
- Extract effective acoustic features from raw audio signals
- Train and evaluate the model on standard emotional speech datasets
- Analyze and compare performance across different datasets
